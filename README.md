# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic Snake game, where you control a snake to eat food and grow longer without hitting the walls or yourself.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
- The snake will continuously move in the direction you choose.
- Guide the snake to eat the food that appears on the game board.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
- Be careful not to let the snake collide with the walls or itself, as it will result in game over.
- The game score increases as you successfully eat food and grow longer.
- Aim for the highest score and challenge yourself to beat it!
